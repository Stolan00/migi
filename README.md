Migi is a desktop application for managing an Anilist library. It is developed with the Qt framework, and is primarily written in C++.  Read the [manual](https://github.com/Stolan00/migi/blob/main/manual.md) to learn more.

Please note, this is a personal project made with the goal of learning about Qt and C++ development. I cannot guarantee support. For a similar program, see [Taiga](https://taiga.moe/).
