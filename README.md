Desktop application for managing an AniList library, inspired by Taiga and made with Qt.

Please note, this is a personal project made with the goal of learning about C++ development within a framework. I cannot guarantee support. For a more feature-complete application serving a similar purpose, see [Taiga](https://taiga.moe/)
